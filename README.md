A look on Benford's Law.
I hope you don't program regularly, because this program is a mess. It is not optimized and was written during
a boring lecture. Thanks for reading anyways :)

# What is Benford's Law?

From WikiPedia:
Benford's law, also called the Newcombâ€“Benford law, the law of anomalous numbers, or the first-digit law, is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading significant digit is likely to be small.[1] For example, in sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1% of the time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on.

# What this script does
This Python script takes csv files in a subdirectory called "Data Sets" and spits out data, so you can see how well each particular data set fits on the Benford's Law.
This script was written during a boring class, so please don't judge my lazy programming.
